# Major hurdles
    The things that gave me more trouble was when I clicked Pokedex of the pokemon, I had to remove all the element and create a new format using DOM manipulation in the javaScript file, and also styling was quite difficult in there. I found some solution to overcome the CSS problem using id or class in the elements though it was time-consuming.
